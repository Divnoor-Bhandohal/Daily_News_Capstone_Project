## Team Expectations

### Work Quality

1.	Project standards:
    - Any code written should be structured, consistent and readable.
    - All code should be properly documented.
    - Code documentation should be simple (where possible) and easy-to-understand.
    - Appropriate commenting should be used.
    - All tasks should be completed on-time.

2.	Strategies to fulfill these standards:
    -	Each member, individually, should read the materials and grasp the main points of assignments, project features and dependencies. If there is anything that a member does not understand clearly, that member should discuss with the other members in order to reach a solution. 
    -	Work will be distributed among the team members so that no one person is given too heavy a workload.
    -	Set internal deadline prior to the official deadline so that the project can be completed on-time.
    -	If anyone cannot complete their parts, they should tell the group beforehand. So that, the others will help them to solve the problem and meet the deadline on-time.

### Team Participation

1.	Strategies to ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks:
    - During our weekly Friday meetings, we will discuss what needs to be done, break down the project into smaller parts and distribute the tasks among the members.
    - Each member must agree to take on the workload suggested. No member should be forced to do a particular task.
    - Each member's individual schedule and personal responsiblities will be considered when distributing tasks, in order to avoid overworking any one member.

2.	Strategies for encouraging/including ideas from all team members (team maintenance):
    -	We should always encourage each other to share our ideas.
    -	Give only constructive comments and criticisms to each others ideas.
    -	Ensure that all team members are involved in any final decisions that are made.

3.	Strategies for keeping on task (task maintenance):
    -	Check each individual's work regularly, before and on the due dates.
    -	Team members should inform the rest of the group when they have completed a task. Therefore, everyone can keep track of the progress.

### Personal Accountability

1. Expected individual attendance, punctuality, and participation at all team meetings:
    -	Should always be on-time for meetings. If there is any reason that a member cannot attend, they MUST inform the group via email or through group chat.

2.	Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines:
    -	Everyone should know their roles and be diligent in completing for their own tasks as well as managing shared-responsiblities.

3.	Expected level of communication with other team members:
    -	Everyone should be respectful and non-hostile when talking to each other.
    -	We cannot guarantee that there will be no conflict. However, whenever conflict does arise, we should be patient and try to resolve the problem cooperatively.

4.	Expected level of commitment to team decisions and tasks.
    -	Ensure that when a decision is made, everyone agrees on and follows it. If anyone has any issue with team decisions or tasks, they should address it in the meeting.
    -	If a member was unable to attend a meeting and they disagree with a decision after being notified of it, then this should be addressed with the entire group present.
