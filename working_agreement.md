## Team Expectations

### Work Quality

1.	Project standards:
    - Any code written should be structured, consistent and readable.
    - All code should be properly documented.
    - Code documentation should be simple (where possible) and easy-to-understand.
    - Appropriate commenting should be used.
    - All tasks should be completed on-time.

2.	Strategies to fulfill these standards:
    -	Each member, individually, should read the materials and grasp the main points of assignments, project features and dependencies. If there is anything that a member does not understand clearly, that member should discuss it with the other members in order to reach a solution. 
    -	Work will be distributed among the team members so that no one person is given too heavy a workload.
    -	Set internal deadlines prior to the official deadline so that the project can be completed on-time.
    -	If anyone cannot complete their parts, they should tell the group beforehand. So that, others will help them to solve the problem and meet the deadline on-time.

3. The coding style and pattern:
    - Use meaningful variable names:
        - don't use single letter variable names except for something like a loop counter.
        - don't use the variable name flag. This is as meaningless as x. especially bad if you have flag1, flag2, etc.
    - Use Camel case for variable and function names(lower case first letter, and lower case in general, upper case first letter of each word other than first).
    - For curly braces place the brace in a new line.
        ```c++
        for(...)
        {
            ...
        }
        ```
    - Use proper indentation for each block of code, so that the code is easily readable.
    - Declare each variable in a new line.
   
### Team Participation

1.	Strategies to ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks:
    - During our weekly Friday meetings, we will discuss what needs to be done, break down the project into smaller parts and distribute the tasks among the members.
    - Each member must agree to take on the workload suggested. No member should be forced to do a particular task.
    - Each member's individual schedule and personal responsibilities will be considered when distributing tasks, in order to avoid overworking any one member.

2.	Strategies for encouraging/including ideas from all team members (team maintenance):
    -	We should always encourage each other to share our ideas.
    -	Give only constructive comments and criticisms to each others ideas.
    -	Ensure that all team members are involved in any final decisions that are made.

3.	Strategies for keeping on task (task maintenance):
    -	Check each individual's work regularly, before and on the due dates.
    -	Team members should inform the rest of the group when they have completed a task. Therefore, everyone can keep track of progress.

### Personal Accountability

1. Expected individual attendance, punctuality, and participation at all team meetings:
    -	Should always be on-time for meetings. If there is any reason that a member cannot attend, they MUST inform the group via email or through group chat.

2.	Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines:
    -	Everyone should know their roles and be diligent in completing for their own tasks as well as managing shared-responsibilities.

3.	Expected level of communication with other team members:
    -	Everyone should be respectful and non-hostile when talking to each other.
    -	We cannot guarantee that there will be no conflict. However, whenever a conflict does arise, we should be patient and try to resolve the problem cooperatively.

4.	Expected level of commitment to team decisions and tasks.
    -	Ensure that when a decision is made, everyone agrees on and follows it. If anyone has any issues with team decisions or tasks, they should address it in the meeting.
    -	If a member was unable to attend a meeting and they disagree with a decision after being notified of it, then this should be addressed with the entire group present.
