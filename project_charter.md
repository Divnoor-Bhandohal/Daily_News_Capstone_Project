# News & Weather Data Web App

## 1. Introduction

This project aims to create a web application that allows a user to search for and view worldwide news data and weather. News data will be searched primarily using keywords and will be retrieved based on relevance to the keywords entered. Additionally, data can also be searched for by date published, domain name of the data source and the language of the article. Furthermore, our application will also allow the user to retrieve weather data for the same areas from which the news articles originate. The user will be able to login and create an account, where they can save the prefrences such as the genre of the news and the locations they want to see the weather data for.
