## Task 2 (18.3/20)

### Project Descrition
Appropriate work. Some fields may be missing. The project description is mostly clear and most of the required tools are present. More tools, specially the one pertaining user saving preferences are missing. (5/7.5)*(2/3)
 
### Project Overview
Excellent work. The project overviewis clear and written in a concise manner. (7.5/7.5)*(2/3)

### Technical Details (10/10)
Missing items and/or confusion of the roles of different technologies. There should be a discussion about APIS. Also, it should consider the use of different Front-End libraries such as React/Angular/Vue. Also, Consider Back-end libraries such as Node.JS, etc. (5/15)*(2/3). Extended to the 14th. Done!!!

## Task 3

### Use cases 
- **User edits their Category Preferences (done by Arryell Parris)** - There is an extra Main Flow that seems to be unrelated to this. One of the alternate flows seens to be out of place. 6/10
- **User search for News Data By using Keywords (done by Yazur Garg)** - Step two of the main flow should have been broken down 8/10
- **User search for Weather data (By Anshul Gandhi)** - The Actor field should only explain who the actor is. Main flow does not mention API. Steps 2 and 3 are out of synch. I belive that the idea was to let users either select a previously favorited location, or choose a new one. However, this is not clear from the flow. Multiple typos. 4/10
- **User creates an account ( By Divnoor Bhandohal)** - More alternate flows should have been considered. For example, if the user cancels the actions prior to the end. 8/10

### Milestones (3/5)
- Item 5 should be broken down into back end and hosting
- Item 6 should be removed (it is part of each step)
- Item 11 should porbably discuss the design of the "pushing the application to the host"

### Deliverables (5/5)

## Task 4

### Risks, Assumptions, and Constraints (5/5)
Perfect!

### README.md (5/5)
No changes requested

### Use Cases
- **User Delete their own account (By Anshul Gandhi)** - Perfect! (10/10)
- **User changing their account password (done by Yazur Garg)** - Perfect! (10/10)
- **User edits their Category Preferences (done by Arryell Parris)** - Perfect! (10/10)
- **ser Logs into the Application ( By Divnoor Bhandohal )** - Great job! (8/10) There should be a step prior to 1, where the user clicks on a button to start the login process. Or, yo ucould have stated in your pre-conditions that the user was already in such a page. User forgetting his/her password should eb a different case. Postcondition should make it clear that a session was created and, therefore, the user can access login-required functionalities.
- **User saves their Location Data (done by Arryell Parris)** Extra (not graded). There were a few typos, and the use case is not saved as a .md file. Otherwise, no other issues!
