## Our idea

This project aims to create a web application allows a user to search for and view worldwide news data and weather. News data will be searched for primarily using keywords and will be retrieved based on relevance to the keywords entered. Additionally, data can also be searched for by date published, domain name of the data source and the language of the article. Our web application will present the search results in tabular format with a summary of the information within each article similar to modern search engines. Furthermore, our application will also allow the user to retrieve weather data for the same area that the news articles originate from

The technologies we are planing to use for the web application are angular, mongo DB, bootstrap and multipal APIs.

### List of the APIs 
- [NEWS Api](https://newsapi.org/) to get the news data for the user.
- [OpenWeather Api](https://openweathermap.org/) to get the weather data.
